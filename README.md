*  In this project I've build a model  architecture using CNN by pytorch. This Model can classify three categories (cat, dog and car).

* I've collect the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and [Imagenet](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html).


*  This dataset consist of train, valid and test set. and 13500 image.

* The training set contain 9000 images, 3000 image for each class. 

* The test set contain 3000 images, 1000 image for each class. 

* The validation set contain 1500 images, 500 image for each class.

## Dataset Gathering 

###  This dataset is comination between two daatasets which are: 

*   Cats Vs. Dogs From Kaggle [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
*   Cars Dataset From Imagenet Stanford [Here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)
